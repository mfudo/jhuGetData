========================================================

The dataset "all_data_tidy.txt" was created by merging two 
datasets that were obtained here: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The dataset "all_means_tidy.txt" was created by calculating
the means for each variable by subject and by activity.

The script used for the merging and analysis is "run_analysis.R"

Descriptions of the study, variables, and column names can be found
in the "README.txt" and "feature_info.txt" files in this folder.
